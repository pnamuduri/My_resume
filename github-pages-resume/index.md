## Summary
Results-driven civil/environmental engineer with experience in wastewater infrastructure (headworks, lift stations, odor control) and strong cross-disciplinary background in structural analysis (ACI‑350), hydraulics (TCEQ compliance), and data automation (Python). Proven ability to design, test, and deliver compliant, cost-effective solutions.

## Core Skills
- Water/Wastewater infrastructure: headworks, lift stations, wet wells/dry wells, bypass planning
- Structural: ACI‑350 water-retaining, plate modeling (STAAD.Pro), AutoCAD production
- Compliance: TCEQ standards, FEMA-CD rehabilitation guidance, safety and operations
- Data/Automation: Python, REST APIs, instrumentation (LAMDA‑3® drawdown), n8n + Docker
- Communication: proposals, technical reports, reconciliatory client correspondence

## Experience
**Neera Associates, Inc. — Senior Engineer** *(YYYY–Present)*  
- Led structural evaluations and rehabilitation plans for municipal headworks and lift stations.
